# Exploring Node JS
I've been writing NodeJS professionally for a little over a year, and I'm now realizing that I never did formally learn the JavaScript runtime. This repository is a dump of notes from textbooks and tutorials about NodeJS. 

I'm adding them in an erratic manner, which means this won't be a comprehensive exploration of NodeJS, and will be more closely formed around gaps in *my* knowledge.

Feel free to fork this repository and begin branching out on your personal quest.
